If

If a man could live a thousand years,
    When half his life had passed,
He might, by strict economy,
    A fortune have amassed.

Then having gained some common-sense,
    And knowledge, too, of life,
He could select the woman who
    Would make him a true wife.

But as it is, man hasn't time
    To even pay his debts,
And weds to be acquainted with
    The woman whom he gets.
